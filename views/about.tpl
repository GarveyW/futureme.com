  <h1>The Story</h1>
  <p>I started this project with a phenomenal team at a UC Berkeley health data hackathon. Since then, I've continued to tinker with and expand the site. I've got big aspirations for the project! Currently, the team is lonely little me, but if you kick ass and find changing an industry and saving lives and billions of dollars really awesome, send me a note, and we'll see what happens!

    <p>I'm variously a hacker, college drop-out, developer, and adventurer. I live in San Francisco bay - drop me a line to chat! I love meeting and chatting with more people who are also passionate about life.</p>

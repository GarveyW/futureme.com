    <h1>The Story</h1>
    <p>This project started out in October 2011 at <a href="http://entrepreneurship.berkeley.edu/resources/health_data_hackathon.html">Hacking Health</a>, a health data hackathon at UC Berkeley. The kind folks over at Practice Fusion made available a large set of patient data, and our team used that data to build an application that allows the user to visualize how their current health choices affect their future health outcomes. During that 1-day hackathon, we built the core of this product. Since then, I've remained very much interested in the space and continued to develop the application. I'm eager to see the application grow.

      <p>I'm variously a hacker, developer, and adventurer. I live in San Francisco bay, taking time off from school to work at a start-up. I'm really interested in solving the big problems out there - and vastly improving healthcare is one of them. I've been programming for a long time, but only know about the healthcare space what I read about and learn from amazing people. I'm really excited about the changing future of healthcare and technology, and I hope to learn a lot more about the space through this project.

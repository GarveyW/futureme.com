      <p>You already know that smoking is bad for you. You know the stats. Smokers have up to 6 times the likelihood of developing heart disease. Smoking takes away 8.3 years of your life on average. 
      <p>But, why and how should you quit?

      <p>The average pack of cigarettes costs $5.68. For someone smoking one pack per day, that's $2,000 dollars a year. Enough for more than a few iPads. Or a gym membership for the whole family, or the down payment on a new car. Quitting smoking is winning the lottery - every single year.

      <p>Both smoking and weight gain put you in danger of heart disease. Just how much? Smoking is the same as gaining 150 pounds. 1. 5. 0. That's a lot of holiday hams. Stop smoking, and you're slimming down a lot more than just the cigarettes.

      <p>The smell of cigarettes isn't the only thing that keeps people away. You'll live shorter. 8 fewer years making memories with your family, and 8 fewer years doing what you love.
